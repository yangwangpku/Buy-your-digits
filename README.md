## Rules of the Game
1. Each player starts with a random sequence of 5 digits ranging from 1-4.
2. Players take turns to either make a guess or challenge the opponent's last guess.
3. A guess must be more aggressive than the last (e.g., after (3 3s), valid guesses include (3 4s), (5 1s), or (6 2s)).
4. A challenge ends the round and reveals all digits to verify the last guess.
5. The round loser loses one digit. The game continues until a player loses all digits.
